#  What may be broken.  Linuxrc does not seem to accept a netdevice parameter of MAC address, it only seems to accept
#  interface names such as em1.  From the documentation it seems that if no netdevice is provided it will go through
#  all available interfaces and apply and keep the settings to one tha works.  This seems to work on my system when
#  I switch between port 1 and 2, but I also have no other networks available.  So that is why currently we don't use
#  the MAC address to pick the PXE install device, but we should do some more testing to ensure this always works.
#  Here is where the doc says they'll search for an interface that works: https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Linuxrc#Classical
